# Prescriptive Analytics Seminar - Orienteering Problem with Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)

This repository contains the work I completed during the **Prescriptive Analytics** seminar at **Dresden University of Technology**. The primary focus of the seminar was to solve optimization problems using a solver architecture.

## Overview

As part of the course, we explored a variety of optimization problems and learned to implement solutions using different optimization techniques. For my exam, I tackled the **Orienteering Problem**, a well-known problem in the field of combinatorial optimization. I used the **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)** metaheuristic to develop an efficient solution to the problem.

### Orienteering Problem

The Orienteering Problem involves finding the most efficient route through a set of locations, with the goal of maximizing the total score obtained by visiting selected locations, while staying within a given time or distance constraint. The challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between visiting high-value locations and completing the route within the allowed limit.

### Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)

[Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_neighborhood_search) is a metaheuristic algorithm designed to escape local optima by systematically changing the neighborhood structures during the search process. By exploring increasingly distant neighborhoods, VNS enhances the chances of finding a global optimum.
