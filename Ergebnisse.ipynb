    "- Metaheuristik funktioniert und erreicht Verbesserung\n",
    "- Konstruktive Heuristiken liefern bereits gute Ergebnisse, die oft nur geringfügig verbessert werden (ca. 5-10 %)\n",
    "- Zeitraum bis zum Abbruchkriterium wird quasi nie ausgereizt\n",
    "- Möglicher Grund dafür sind die gewählten Nachbarschaften\n",
    "- Idee, Tour mit Intra-Tour Tauschen zu komprimieren, um dann weitere Knoten hinzuzufügen funktioniert, aber wenig effizient\n",
    "- Vor allem durch radikalere Nachbarschaften hätte Lösung verbessert werden können\n",
    "    - für raffinierte Nachbarschaftsingenieurkunst hat am Ende die Zeit gefehlt\n",
    "- Aus der 'Parameteranalyse' hat sich die Kombination aus NNF und BestMove am besten geschlagen"
